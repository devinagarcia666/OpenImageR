## OpenImageR 1.0.2

Currently, Software platforms like OSX do not support openmp, thus I've made openmp optional for all functions.

## OpenImageR 1.0.1

I modified the Makevars files, so that OpenImageR can be installed error-free in,

* r-devel-osx-x86_64-clang
* r-patched-solaris-sparc
* r-patched-solaris-x86
* r-oldrel-windows-ix86+x86_64

## OpenImageR 1.0.0
